css to remove lots of 'extra' whitespace

I want to glance at new news feed items, I don't want to scroll through pages of changes.

I want to glance at my repositories.

## Setup
1. Install the [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/) plugin for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/?src=external-userstyleshome) or [Safari](http://sobolev.us/stylish/)
2. Navigate to page you want edited
3. click on add-on/extension
4. click on `write style for <url>`
4a. for mac click `<manage styles>` then click `<edit>`
5. paste in css changes, choose name, choose URL/URLs for domain

 - if you pick URL you need the full uri including protocol: `https://github.com/`, domain just needs: `github.com`

6. save style
7. refresh target page/site to see changes
